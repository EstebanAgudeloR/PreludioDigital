Overview

Preludio Digital is an interactive training device designed to improve finger independence and coordination for pianists and musicians. Using LEDs and push buttons mapped to each finger, the system generates light patterns that the user must replicate, providing both visual and auditory feedback.

Developed on an STM32 microcontroller as part of a Digital Electronics course, the project combines hardware interaction with structured software design.

Key Features

Finite State Machines (FSMs):

SystemFSM â†’ Handles serial communication and command parsing.

GameFSM â†’ Controls gameplay logic, LED patterns, timing, and scoring.

Serial command interface (UART):

Configuration through Linux-like commands, e.g.:

D1 T2000 R10
â†’ Difficulty = 1, Response time = 2000 ms, Rounds = 10.

Interactive feedback:

LEDs guide user actions.

Push buttons register responses.

LCD and buzzer provide real-time feedback and game results.

Game logic:

Multiple difficulty levels (from single finger to complex combinations).

Round-based evaluation with accuracy percentage and performance messages.

Extra modes: free play and memory challenges.

Skills Strengthened

Embedded C programming on STM32.

State machine architecture for modular and maintainable logic.

Serial parsing and command execution for configurable systems.

Real-time event handling with GPIOs, timers, and interrupts.

User interface design combining hardware (LEDs, buttons, buzzer) and software (UART, LCD).

ðŸ’¡ This project blends music training with embedded systems engineering, highlighting both creativity and technical implementation.
